# Deep-Q-learning-Game-Solver
The following is a 2D predator/prey game designed by Anand Patel played in a maze. 
The code sets up the maze, places items & loot, and fixes an exit door at a node through the edges.csv, nodes.csv

The code is executed from the main_labyrinth.m file, segment-by-segment in MATLAB. 

I used 32 GB of memory to store the trained agent in a Q-table. Deep Q-learning can be implemented by replacing the functions storing the input data in this Q-table with sending the inputs to a specified neural network being trained. This is a potential future extension of the project.

Further details of how I ran my code and experiments can be found in the attached report.
